BCD_7SEGMENT
Aim:
To design and simulate BCD 7 Segment using vivado.

Apparatus Required
PC with vivado software.

Procedure:

STEP:1 Start the vivado software, Select and Name the New project.

STEP:2 Select the device family, device, package and speed.

STEP:3 Select new source in the New Project and select Verilog Module as the Source type.

STEP:4 Type the File Name and module name and Click Next and then finish button. Type the code and save it.

STEP:5 Select the run simulation and then run Behavioral Simulation in the Source Window and click the check syntax.

STEP:6 Click the simulation to simulate the program and give the inputs and verify the outputs as per the truth table.

STEP:7 compare the output with truth table.

program:
```
//Verilog module.
module segment7(
     bcd,
     seg
    );
     
     //Declare inputs,outputs and internal variables.
     input [3:0] bcd;
     output [6:0] seg;
     reg [6:0] seg;

//always block for converting bcd digit into 7 segment format
    always @(bcd)
    begin
        case (bcd) //case statement
            0 : seg = 7'b0000001;
            1 : seg = 7'b1001111;
            2 : seg = 7'b0010010;
            3 : seg = 7'b0000110;
            4 : seg = 7'b1001100;
            5 : seg = 7'b0100100;
            6 : seg = 7'b0100000;
            7 : seg = 7'b0001111;
            8 : seg = 7'b0000000;
            9 : seg = 7'b0000100;
            //switch off 7 segment character when the bcd digit is not a decimal number.
            default : seg = 7'b1111111; 
        endcase
    end
endmodule
```
output:

Result:

Thus the BCD 7 Segment is verified succcessfully.
